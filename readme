Current flow:
	- VideoPhone.swf loads config xml first when started.
	- Then preload 33 phone image pngs (3.5 MB), they are compressed and cropped for optimization.
	- It then preload two audio files (2MB).  Once that finishes, it then start streaming the video and auto pause on the first frame.
	- User can start the video by click play button or rotating the phone by dragging.
	- Sound pans left/right depends on the angle of the phone.  Sound switch to low fi when back of the phone is revealed.  Video player moves/shrink as well with user intereaction.
